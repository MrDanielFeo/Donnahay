		<p>At the age of eight, Donna Hay skipped into a kitchen, picked up a mixing bowl and never looked back. <br>
      Donna Hay is Australia’s leading food editor and best-selling cookbook author. Her food, recipes and styling focus on basic ingredients that are simply prepared and beautifully photographed – hallmarks of her work which have set the benchmark for food publishing worldwide and inspired a whole new generation of cooks.
    <br><br>
    Donna’s career as a food writer and stylist began when she was 19. She was appointed food editor of marie claire when she was 25 and soon became food editor of marie claire lifestyle, too.
    <br><br>
    In 2001 she launched donna hay magazine, a highly acclaimed, top-selling bi-monthly food magazine with tremendous local success and far-reaching international appeal. With Donna as editor-in-chief, the magazine has more than 730,000 Australian readers each issue*, has subscribers in 82 countries around the world and is the highest-selling magazine on the App Store in Australia.
    <br><br>
    Donna has a popular weekly food column in the Sunday editions of News Corp newspapers around Australia and The New Zealand Herald, reaching over four million people each week. She is also a regular contributor to UK’s leading lifestyle magazine, Living etc.
    <br><br>
    Her simple and style-driven approach is reflected in her 22 award-winning cookbooks. She has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide and her books have been translated into nine languages.
    <br><br>
    In 2011, Donna completed her first television series – fast, fresh, simple – for The LifeStyle Channel in Australia. The series screened in more than 17 countries worldwide. In December 2013, the one-hour special, a donna hay Christmas, was created exclusively for Foxtel in Australia, bringing to life Donna’s no-fuss, chic approach to Christmas entertaining.
    <br><br>
    Donna was named one of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ cookbook authors at the international Gourmand Awards in January 2007, and received an ASTRA award in 2012 for best new female personality. In December 2011, Oprah Winfrey appointed Donna as the creative director for the ‘Welcome to Sydney’ party, for her and the 300 audience members who travelled to Australia for the special series of shows. The segment, seen by more than 20 million people worldwide, included Donna’s transformation of Sydney Harbour settings into stylish beach and country locations, plus fireworks that lit up the night’s sky and Sydney Harbour Bridge – especially for Oprah.
    <br><br>
    Donna’s successful homewares range was developed with Royal Doulton and has been available worldwide since 2011. This range includes classic dinnerware and collections for tea, cake and special occasions, plus kitchenware and tools for cooking and baking.
    <br><br>
    The Donna Hay Home Baking Mix range, featuring cookie, brownie and cupcake baking kits, is made with all natural ingredients, for a truly homemade taste. The range is well loved and stocked in major supermarkets. It includes pretty baking accessories too which, in true Donna Hay style, are special made simple.
    <br><br>
    In early 2009, Donna launched the donna hay general store, which has quickly grown into a booming online business, allowing food and style lovers all over the world to obtain Donna’s products, beautiful homewares and special gift ideas at the click of a button. With delivery to home, office and via the gift registry service, Donna’s fast, fresh and simple ideas are truly accessible to every home.
