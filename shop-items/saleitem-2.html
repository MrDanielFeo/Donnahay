      	<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wire Cloche - Medium <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<s> Was 34.95</s> Now 24.95</h4>

        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pretty cloches are inspired by Donnaâ€™s own vintage wire collection. They make for a chic set when &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paired with the milk glass cake stands or the donna hay for Royal Doulton cake stands.</p>
        </h5>

        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available in large, medium and small. These pieces are designed to have a rustic quality and, as such, no two &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pieces are identical. You may find small inconsistencies and marks, which adds to the overall beauty and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;character of the piece. The small cloche measures 10cm high x 14cm wide. </p>
